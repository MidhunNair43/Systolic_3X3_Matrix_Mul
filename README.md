# Systolic_3X3_Matrix_Mul
A simple implementation of a 3X3 Matrix Multiplication using Systolic Array 

The module takes two 3X3 matrices and multiplies them using a processing unit. The idea can be extended for any number of square matrices by increasing
the number of the processing units. The module has one cycle for resetting the inital values. The module therefore takes 8 cycles for completion in place
of the traditional 27 cycles for a 3X3 matrix.
